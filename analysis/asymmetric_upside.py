Asymmetric Upside Index.

Flags pitchers with elite Stuff+ but poor results explained by command, not
shape: Index = z(Stuff+) - z(Location+) by default (config.COMMAND_METRIC =
"location_plus"; run analysis/location_plus_proxy.py first). Location+ uses
only location and count, Stuff+ only pitch shape, so the two don't overlap.
config.COMMAND_METRIC = "legacy" switches back to the original Command Proxy,
which is always kept as CommandProxyLegacy for comparison.

Also flags pitch-mix inefficiency: a pitcher whose best-performing pitch
(by Stuff+) isn't their most-thrown pitch is leaving upside on the table by
usage alone, independent of command.

Legacy Command Proxy note: Location+ (the proprietary one) is proprietary, and Statcast has no intended
target, so command can't be measured directly. This proxy instead scores
*zone discipline*: how often a pitcher works the edge of the zone (skill)
vs. the heart of the plate (mistake), plus walk rate. It's a stand-in for
command, not a measurement of it -- see README "Known limitations".

Grading is always league-wide: Stuff+, Command Proxy and the index are
z-scored against every qualified MLB pitcher, pulled one month at a time via
load_season_monthly() (a single full-season pull OOMs on an 8GB machine).
--team only filters the printed output afterwards, so a Pirates pitcher is
compared to the league, not to the rest of the Pirates staff.

Small samples: every pitcher with config.MIN_PITCHES_TO_DISPLAY+ pitches gets
a row (Qualified = False under config.MIN_PITCHES_FOR_INCLUSION). Edge%,
Meatball% and BB% get *_Reg columns regressed toward the qualified pool's mean
(analysis/stabilization.py); Stuff+ and Location+ come in already regressed.
Every z-score uses the QUALIFIED pool's mean and SD, so small samples don't
move anyone else's grade. AsymmetricUpsideIndex uses raw values,
AsymmetricUpsideIndex_Reg the regressed ones; config.USE_REGRESSED picks
which one downstream modules use (both are always saved).

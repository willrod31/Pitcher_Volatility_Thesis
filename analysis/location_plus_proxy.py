"""
Location+ proxy: command measured from pitch location and count ONLY.

Mirrors stuff_plus_proxy.py from the other side -- Stuff+ sees only pitch
shape (velo, movement, spin, extension, release), Location+ sees only where
the pitch ended up and the count it was thrown in. Pitch shape is never a
feature here, so Asymmetric Upside = z(Stuff+) - z(Location+) separates
"the stuff is good" from "the location is the problem".

Target (per pitch, pitcher's point of view, lower = better for the pitcher):
delta_run_exp, except on balls in play, where it's replaced by an EXPECTED
run value -- a league regression of delta_run_exp on xwOBA
(estimated_woba_using_speedangle) + balls + strikes -- so batted-ball luck
isn't credited or charged to command.

Features: norm_x (plate_x / half plate width, flipped for LHB so positive is
always the same side of the batter), norm_z (height relative to the batter's
own zone, same normalization as asymmetric_upside.classify_zone_location),
balls, strikes, same_hand.

One HistGradientBoostingRegressor per pitch group (fastball / breaking /
offspeed), trained on every pitch league-wide. Predictions are out-of-fold
(5-fold GroupKFold by pitcher), so a pitcher's own pitches never train the
model that scores him.

LocationPlus = 100 + 10 * z(-mean predicted run value), z against the
league-wide qualified pool (config.MIN_PITCHES_FOR_INCLUSION pitches; per
pitch type, config.MIN_PITCHES_PER_TYPE_FOR_SCALE and z within that pitch
type). 100 = league average, 10 points = 1 SD, higher = better.

LocationPlus_Reg regresses small samples toward 100 with the stabilization
point k from analysis/stabilization.py: (n * LocationPlus + k * 100) / (n + k),
LocationPlus_Reliability = n / (n + k). Blank under config.MIN_PITCHES_TO_DISPLAY
pitches (per pitch type: config.MIN_PITCHES_PER_TYPE_TO_DISPLAY). The mean/SD
behind LocationPlus itself still come from the qualified pool only.

Location+ still can't see the catcher's target: it grades location quality
given the count, not whether the pitcher hit his spot.

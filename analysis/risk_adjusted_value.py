"""
Risk-Adjusted Value Projection.

Projects each pitcher's WAR for the season after config.SEASON (2026 for the
2025 data) and ranks pitchers by multi-year surplus value over their remaining
years of team control, starting that season -- the first one a team acquiring
the pitcher now would get.

WAR (config.WAR_MODEL):
- "calibrated" (default): projected next-season FIP-WAR from
  analysis/war_calibration.py -- a rate model (FIPR9) times a playing-time
  model (IP), fitted on real 2023->2024 results, tested on 2024->2025, refit
  on both. The playing-time model already uses VolatilityScore_Reg and
  InjuryRiskScore (and the rate model may too), so the hand-set
  VOLATILITY_SHRINKAGE / INJURY_SHRINKAGE are NOT applied on top (that would
  count the risk twice): both are set to 0 and a note says which model
  carries the risk.
- "legacy": the old UNCALIBRATED placeholder, LEAGUE_AVG_STARTER_WAR +
  WAR_PER_TALENT_Z x [z(Stuff+) + z(command)], shrunk toward replacement
  level by volatility and injury risk. Always kept as LegacyProjectedWAR
  (= simple_projected_war) for comparison.

ActualWAR<SEASON> is the pitcher's real FIP-WAR that season (analysis/fip_war.py),
and SurplusActual<SEASON> = ActualWAR x $/WAR - that season's salary, a look-back
number only.

Contracts come from the hand-collected data/salaries.csv (joined on
PitcherId). Blank ContractStatus / YearsControl / PreArbYearsLeft /
ArbYearsLeft fall back to contract_status.py's debut-date estimate; blank
Salary for a pre-arb pitcher falls back to the league minimum. Hand-entered
values always win. YearsControl, PreArbYearsLeft and ArbYearsLeft count
config.SEASON as year 1.

Multi-year surplus (project_control_years) starts the season after SEASON
(year t = 0, discount factor 1). Remaining control = YearsControl - 1;
SEASON's stage is used up (PreArbYearsLeft - 1 if any are left, otherwise
ArbYearsLeft - 1, and the arb year index moves up one). One row per remaining
control year, capped at config.MAX_CONTROL_YEARS, with ProjectedWAR held
FLAT (no aging curve). Salary per year: GuaranteedFuture when listed; league
minimum for pre-arb years; max(prior salary, ARB_PCT_OF_MARKET x WAR x $/WAR)
for arb years (prior salary starts at SEASON's salary); AAV / prior salary
otherwise. $/WAR = DOLLARS_PER_WAR x (1 + DOLLARS_PER_WAR_GROWTH) ** (t + 1).
Surplus = WAR x $/WAR - Salary, discounted by (1 + DISCOUNT_RATE) ** t.
Pitchers with no control left (free agents after SEASON) get a blank
MultiYearSurplus and a ValueNote saying so -- not a zero. All of those rates
are assumptions in config.py.

Small samples: asymmetric_upside.py / volatility_discount.py include
pitchers under config.MIN_PITCHES_FOR_INCLUSION (Qualified = False). With
config.USE_REGRESSED the legacy WAR proxy and shrinkage use the regressed
(*_Reg) Stuff+, command and volatility percentile; z-scores always use the
qualified pool's mean/SD. Raw columns stay in the output.

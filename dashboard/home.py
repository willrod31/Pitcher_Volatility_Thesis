3. **Find the gap.** Pitchers whose Stuff+ is well above their Location+ have great stuff that is held back by
   command, which is more fixable than stuff.
4. **Measure the risk.** **Volatility** (how much velocity and release point change from outing to outing) and
   **injury history** (IL stints over the last {INJURY_LOOKBACK_SEASONS} seasons).
5. **Put a price on it.** Project each pitcher's {NEXT_SEASON} WAR from his talent, results, playing time and risk,

  Hits on balls in play are left out, because they depend a lot on the defense and luck.

Next season's WAR is built from two separate predictions, both learned from what really happened to every pitcher

- **How good per inning** (runs allowed per 9 innings): from Stuff+, Location+, his role and this season's results.
- **How many innings**: from this season's innings, his age, his injury history and his volatility. A pitcher who
  got hurt or lost his job and threw 0 innings the next year is part of the data, so the risk is built in.

The two are combined with the same WAR formula as above. Because injury and volatility already shape the innings
prediction, there is **no extra hand-set risk discount** on top.

Fitted on 2023→2024 and tested on 2024→2025, a season it never saw, it predicted next-season WAR much better than
the old formula and a little better than "same as last year". It is cautious: the very best pitchers are projected
about 0.8 WAR lower than they tend to produce, because it pulls everyone toward average.
